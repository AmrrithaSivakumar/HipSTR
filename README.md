## Introduction
Short tandem repeats [(STRs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite) are highly repetitive genomic sequences comprised of repeated copies of an underlying motif. Prevalent in most organisms' genomes, STRs are of particular interest because they mutate much more rapidly than most other genomic elements. As a result, they're extremely informative for genomic identification, ancestry inference and genealogy.

Despite their utility, STRs are particularly difficult to genotype. The repetitive sequence responsible for their high mutability also results in frequent alignment errors that can complicate and bias downstream analyses. In addition, PCR stutter errors often result in reads that contain additional or fewer repeat copies than the true underlying genotype. 

**HipSTR** was specifically developed to deal with these errors in the hopes of obtaining more robust STR genotypes. In particular, it accomplishes this by:

1. Learning locus-specific PCR stutter models using an [EM algorithm] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm)
2. Mining candidate STR alleles from population-scale sequencing data
2. Utilizing phased SNP haplotypes to genotype, phase and/or impute STRs
3. Employing a specialized hidden Markov model to align reads to candidate sequences while accounting for stutter



## Installation
HipSTR requires a standard c++ compiler and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/).
To obtain HipSTR and all of its associated submodules, use:

    % git clone --recursive https://github.com/tfwillems/HipSTR.git

To build, use Make:

    % cd HipSTR
    % make

On Mac, before running Make, change the line in *vcflib/smithwaterman/Makefile* from `LDFLAGS=-Wl,-s` to `LDFLAGS=-Wl`

## Quick Start
To run HipSTR in its most broadly applicable mode, run it on **all samples concurrently** using the syntax:
```
./HipSTR --bams          run1.bam,run2.bam,run3.bam,run4.bam
         --fasta         /data/
         --regions       str_regions.bed
         --stutter-out   stutter_models.txt
         --str-vcf       str_calls.vcf.gz
```
* **--bam** :  a comma-separated list of [BAM](#bams) files generated by any indel-sensitive aligner (e.g. [BWA-MEM](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml)) and sorted and indexed using [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
* **--regions** : a [BED](#str-bed) file containing the coordinates for each STR region of interest
* **--fasta** : the directory containing [FASTA files] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) for each chromosome in the BED file. In the above usage example, if *str_regions.bed* contains chr1, chr2, and chr10, the corresponding files would be */data/chr1.fa*, */data/chr2.fa* and */data/chr10.fa*. Alternatively, you can supply the path for a single FASTA file containing all of the relevant sequences

For each region in *str_regions.bed*, **HipSTR** will:

1. Learn locus-specific stutter models and output them to *stutter_models.txt*
2. Use the stutter model and haplotype-based alignment algorithm to genotype each individual
3. Output the resulting STR genotypes to *str_calls.vcf.gz*, a [bgzipped] (http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) [VCF](#str-vcf) file. This VCF will contain calls for each sample in any of the BAM files' read groups. 

## In-depth Usage
**HipSTR** has a variety of usage options designed to accomodate scenarios in which the sequencing data varies in terms of the number of samples and the coverage. Most scenarios will fall into one of the following categories:

1. 200 or more low-coverage (~5x) samples
    * Sufficient reads for stutter estimation
    * Sufficient reads to detect candidate STR alleles
    * [**Use de novo stutter estimation + STR calling with de novo allele generation**](#mode-1)
2. 50 or more high-coverage (~30x) samples
    * Sufficient reads for stutter estimation
    * Sufficient reads to detect candidate STR alleles
    * [**Use de novo stutter estimation + STR calling with de novo allele generation**](#mode-1)
3. Handful of low-coverage  (~5x) samples
    * Insufficient reads for stutter estimation
    * Insufficient reads to detect candidate STR alleles
    * [**Use external stutter models + STR calling with a reference panel**](#mode-3)
4. Handful of high-coverage (~30x) samples
    * Insufficient samples for stutter estimation
    * Sufficient reads to detect candidate STR alleles
    * [**Use external stutter models + STR calling with de novo allele generation**](#mode-2)

<a id="mode-1"></a>
#### 1. De novo stutter estimation + STR calling with de novo allele generation
This mode is identical to the one suggested in the **Quick Start** section as it suits most applications. HipSTR will output the learned stutter models to *stutter_models.txt* and the STR genotypes in bgzipped VCF format to *str_calls.vcf.gz* 
```
./HipSTR --bams             run1.bam,run2.bam,run3.bam,run4.bam
         --fasta            /data/
         --regions          str_regions.bed
         --stutter-out      stutter_models.txt
         --str-vcf          str_calls.vcf.gz
```

<a id="mode-2"></a>
#### 2. External stutter models + STR calling with de novo allele generation
The sole difference in this mode is that we no longer output stutter models using the **--stutter-out** option and instead input them from a file using the **--stutter-in** file. For more details on the stutter model file format, see [below](#stutter-file). For humans, we've provided a file containing stutter models for each STR locus under PCR or PCR-free conditions at [FILL ME IN](www.google.com)
```
./HipSTR --bams             run1.bam,run2.bam,run3.bam,run4.bam
         --fasta            /data/
         --regions          str_regions.bed
         --stutter-in       ext_stutter_models.txt
         --str-vcf          str_calls.vcf.gz
```

<a id="mode-3"></a>
#### 3. External stutter models + STR calling with a reference panel
This mode is very similar to mode #2, except that we provide an additional VCF file containing known STR genotypes at each locus using the **--str-vcf** option. **HipSTR** will not identify any additional candidate STR alleles in the BAMs when this option is specified, so it's best to use a VCF that contains STR genotypes for a wide range of populations and individuals. For humans, we've provided such a file based on the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org/) at [FILL ME IN](www.google.com)
```
./HipSTR --bams             run1.bam,run2.bam,run3.bam,run4.bam
         --fasta            /data/
         --regions          str_regions.bed
         --stutter-in       ext_stutter_models.txt
         --ref-vcf          ref_strs.vcf.gz
         --str-vcf          str_calls.vcf.gz
```


### Imputation

### Phasing
HipSTR utilizes phased SNP haplotypes to phase the resulting STR genotypes. To do so, it looks for pairs of reads in which the STR-containing read or its mate pair overlap a samples's heterozygous SNP. In these instances, the quality score for the overlapping base can be used to determine the likelihood that the read came from each haplotype. Alternatively, when this information is not available, we assign the read an equal likelihood of coming from either strand. These likelihoods are incorporated into the HipSTR genotyping model which outputs phased genotypes. The quality of a phasing is reflected in the *PQ* FORMAT field, which provides the posterior probability of each sample's phased genotype. For homozygous genotypes, this value will always equal the *Q* FORMAT field as phasing is irrelevant. However, for heterozygous genotypes, if *PQ ~ Q*, it indicates that one of the two phasings is much more favorable. Alterneatively, if none of a sample's reads overlap heterozygous SNPs, both phasings will be equally probable and *PQ ~ Q/2*. To enable the use of physical phasing, supply HipSTR with the `--snp-vcf` option and a SNP VCF containing **phased** haplotypes. The schematic below outlines the concepts beyond HipSTR's physical phasing model:

![Phasing schematic!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfwillems/HipSTR/master/img/phasing.png)

## Speed
HipSTR doesn't currently have multi-threaded support, but there are several options available to accelerate analyses:

1. Analyze each chromosome in parallel using the **--chrom** option. For example, **--chrom chr2** will only genotype the BED regions on chr2
2. Utilize the length-based genotyper instead of the sequence-based genotyper using the **--len-genotyper** flag. This will vastly accelerate analyses, but it only considers the sizes of indels in reads independently. As a result, it is incapable of determining the exact sequence of an STR and is susceptible to alignment errors
3. If you have hundreds of BAM files, we recommend that you merge them into a more manageable number (10-100) using the `samtools merge` command. Large numbers of BAMs can lead to slow disk IO and poor performance

## Call Filtering
Although **HipSTR** mitigates many of the most common sources of STR genotyping errors, it's still extremely important to filter the resulting VCFs to discard low quality calls. To facilitate this process, the VCF output contains various FORMAT and INFO fields that are usually indicators of problematic calls. The INFO fields indicate the aggregate data for a locus and, if certain flags are raised, may suggest that the entire locus should be discarded. In contrast, FORMAT fields are available on a per-sample basis for each locus and, if certain flags are raised, suggest that some samples' genotypes should be discarded. The list below includes some of these fields and how they can be informative:

####INFO fields:  
1. **DP**: Reports the total depth/number of informative reads for all samples at the locus. The mean coverage per-sample can obtained by dividing this value by the number of samples with non-missing genotypes. In general, genotypes with a low mean coverage are unreliable because the reads may only have captured one of the two alleles if an individual is heterozygous.
2. **DSTUTTER**: Reports the total number of reads at a locus with what HipSTR thinks is a stutter artifact. If the total fraction of reads with stutter (DSTUTTER/DP) is high, genotypes for a locus will be unreliable because the reads frequently don't reflect the true underlying genotype. A high fraction of stutter-containing reads can be caused by too much PCR amplification, a duplicated locus that is mapping to a single location in the genome, or a failure of HipSTR to identify sufficient candidate alleles.  
3. **DFLANKINDEL**: Reports the total number of reads for which the maximum likelihood alignment contains an indel in the regions flanking the STR. A high fraction of reads with this artifact (DFLANKINDEL/DP) can be caused by an actual indel in a region neighboring the STR. However, it can also arise if HipSTR fails to identify sufficient candidate alleles. When these alleles are very different in size from the candidate alleles or are non-unit multiples, they're frequently aligned as indels in the flanking sequences.

####FORMAT fields:  
1. **Q**: Reports the posterior probability of the genotype. We've found that this is the best indicator of quality of an individual sample's genotype and nearly always utilize it to filter calls.   
2. **DP**, **DSTUTTER** and **DFLANKINDEL**: Identical to the INFO field case, these fields are also available for each sample and can be used in the same way to identify problematic individual calls.  

**So what thresholds do we suggest for each of these fields?** The answer really depends on the quality of the sequencing data, the ploidy of the chromosome and the downstream applications. However, we typically apply the following filters usings scripts we've provided in the **scripts** subdirectory of the HipSTR folder:
```
    python scripts/filter_vcf.py    --vcf                   diploid_hipstr_calls.vcf.gz
                                    --min-call-qual         0.9
                                    --max-call-flank-indel  0.15
                                    --max-call-stutter      0.15
    
    python scripts/filter_haploid_vcf.py    --vcf                   haploid_str_calls.vcf.gz
                                            --min-call-qual         0.9
                                            --max-call-flank-indel  0.15
                                            --max-call-stutter      0.15
```
The resulting VCF, which is printed to the standard output stream, will omit calls on a sample-by-sample basis in which any of the following conditions are met: i) the posterior < 90%, ii) more than 15% of reads have a flank indel or iii) more than 15% of reads have a stutter artifact. Calls for samples failing these criteria will be replaced with a "." missing symbol as per the VCF specification. For more filtering options, type either
```
    python scripts/filter_vcf.py -h
    python scripts/filter_haploid_vcf.py -h
```

<a id="aln-viz"></a>
## Alignment Visualization
When deciphering and inspecting STR calls, it's extremely useful to visualize the supporting reads. HipSTR facilitates this through the **--viz-out** option, which writes a bgzipped file containing alignments for each call that can be readily visualized using the **VizAln** command included in HipSTR main directory. If you're interested in visualizing alignments, you first need to index the file using tabix. 
For example, if you ran HipSTR with the option `--viz-out aln.html.gz`, you should use the command
```
tabix -p bed aln.html.gz
```
to generate a [tabix] (http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) index for the file so that we can rapidly extract alignments for a locus of interest. This command only needs to be run once after the file has been generated. 

You could then visualize the calls for sample *ERR218433* at locus *chr1 51639636* using the command
```
./VizAln aln.html.gz chr1 51639636 ERR218433
```
This command will automatically open a rendering of the alignments in your browser and might look something like:
![Read more words!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfwillems/HipSTR/master/examples/example_viz.png)
The top bar represents the reference sequence and the red text indicates the name of the sample and its associated call at the locus. The remaining rows indicate the alignment for each read used in genotyping. In this particular example, 7 reads have a *4bp deletion*, 9 reads have a *8bp deletion* and 1 read has a *12bp deletion*. The solitary *12bp deletion* is likely the result of PCR stutter and HipSTR therefore genotypes this sample as *-4 | -8*

If we wanted to inspect all calls for the same locus, we could  use the command 
```
./VizAln aln.html.gz chr1 51639636
```
NOTE: Because the **--viz-out** file can become fairly large if you're genotyping thousands of loci or thousands of samples, in some scenarios it may be best to rerun HipSTR using this option on the subset of loci in which you're interested.

## File Formats
<a id="bams"></a>
### BAM files
HipSTR requires [BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) files produced by any indel-sensitive aligner. These files must have been sorted by position using the `samtools sort` command and then indexed using `samtools index`. To associate a read with its sample of interest, HipSTR uses read group information in the BAM header lines. These *@*RG lines must contain an *ID* field, an *LB* field indicating the library and an *SM* field indicating the sample. For example, if a BAM contained the following header line 
> *@*RG     ID:RUN1 LB:ERR12345        SM:SAMPLE789

an alignment with the RG tag 
> RG:Z:RUN1

will be associated with sample *SAMPLE789* and library *ERR12345*. In this manner, HipSTR can analyze BAMs containing more than one sample and/or more than one library and can handle BAMs in which a single sample's reads are spread across multiple files. 

Alternatively, if your BAM files lack *RG* information, you can use the **--bam-samps** and **-bam-lbs** flags to specify the sample and library associated with each BAM. In this setting, however, a BAM can only contain a single library and a single read group. For example, the command
```
./HipSTR --bams             run1.bam,run2.bam,run3.bam,run4.bam
         --fasta            /data/
         --regions          str_regions.bed
         --stutter-out      stutter_models.txt
         --str-vcf          str_calls.vcf.gz
         --bam-samps        SAMPLE1,SAMPLE1,SAMPLE2,SAMPLE3
         --bam-lbs          LIB1,LIB2,LIB3,LIB4
```
essentially tells HipSTR to associate all the reads in the first two BAMS with *SAMPLE1*, all the reads in the third file with *SAMPLE2* and all the reads in the last BAM with *SAMPLE3*.

<a id="str-bed"></a>
### STR region BED file
The BED file containing each STR region of interest is a tab-delimited file comprised of 5 required columns and one optional column: 

1. The name of the chromosome on which the STR is located
2. The start position of the STR on its chromosome
3. The end position of the STR on its chromosome
4. The motif length (i.e. the number of bases in the repeat unit)
5. The number of copies of the repeat unit in the reference allele

The 6th column is optional and contains the name of the STR locus, which will be written to the ID column in the VCF. 
Below is an example file which contains 5 STR loci 

**NOTE: The table header is for descriptive purposes. The BED file should not have a header**

CHROM | START | END | MOTIF_LEN | NUM_COPIES | NAME
---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | ---
chr1    | 13784267    | 13784306    | 4 | 10 | GATA27E01
chr1    | 18789523    | 18789555    | 3 | 11 | ATA008
chr2    | 32079410    | 32079469    | 4 | 15 | AGAT117
chr17    | 38994441    | 38994492    | 4 | 12 | GATA25A04
chr17    | 55299940    | 55299992    | 4 | 13 | AAT245

For humans, we've provided a *BED* file containing STR loci for hg19 at [FILL ME IN](www.google.com)

For other model organisms, we recommend that you 

1. Use [Tandem Repeats Finder](https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html) or other tools to scan the reference genome for STRs
2. Reformat the resulting output to conform with the format outlined above
3. We've provdided a simple pipeline that accomplishes this [here](www.google.com)

<a id="str-vcf"></a>
### VCF file
For more information on the VCF file format, please see the [VCF spec](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf). For filtering and parsing VCFs, we recommend the fantastic python package [PyVCF](http://pyvcf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

#### INFO fields
*INFO* fields contains statistics about each genotyped locus in the VCF. The INFO fields reported by HipSTR primarily describe the learned/supplied stutter model for the locus and its reference coordinates and sequence characteristics.

<a id="stutter-file"></a>
### Stutter model
To model PCR stutter artifacts, we assume that there are three types of stutter artifacts:

1. **In-frame changes**: Change the size of the STR in the read by multiples of the repeat unit. For instance, if the repeat motif is AGAT, in-frame changes could lead to differences of -8, -4, 4, 8, and so on. 
2. **Out-of-frame changes**: Change the size of the STR by non-multiples of the repeat unit. For instance, if the repeat motif is AGAT, out-of-frame changes could lead to differences of -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3 and so on. 
3. **No stutter change**: The size of the STR in the read is the same as the size of the underlying STR. 


Stutter model files contain the information necessary to model each of these artifacts in a **tab-delimited BED-like** format with exactly 9 columns. An example of such a file is as follows:

CHROM  | START       | END      | IGEOM | IDOWN | IUP   | OGEOM | ODOWN | OUP
-----  | ----------- | -------- | ----  | ----  | ---   | ----  | ---   | ---
chr1   | 13784267    | 13784306 | 0.95  | 0.05  | 0.01  | 0.9   | 0.01  | 0.001
chr1   | 18789523    | 18789555 | 0.8   | 0.01  | 0.05  | 0.9   | 0.001 | 0.001
chr2   | 32079410    | 32079469 | 0.9   | 0.01  | 0.01  | 0.9   | 0.001 | 0.001
chr17  | 38994441    | 38994492 | 0.9   | 0.001 | 0.001 | 0.9   | 0.001 | 0.001 
chr17  | 55299940    | 55299992 | 0.95  | 0.01  | 0.01  | 0.9   | 0.001 | 0.001

**NOTE: The table header is for descriptive purposes. The stutter file should not have a header**


Each of the stutter parameters is defined as follows:
